As an artist, I paint lines to make space.

The studio, kitchen or workplace must be properly balanced and organized to facilitate the free-flow of ideas, the notion of "mis en place" drives many aspects of my life.

I put great weight and creative energy in designing and tweaking environments and the execution follows suit. I love systems that allow us to play, have fun and explore.

This is my work.
